## Overview 🌐

The **Connect 4 Web App** is a browser-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game. It allows two players to compete against each other on a dynamic and responsive 4x4 grid board. This web app leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Features ✨

- **Interactive 4x4 Grid Board:** The game board is built using CSS Grid, providing a clean and responsive layout.
- **Real-Time Gameplay:** Players take turns by clicking on the grid cells to place their marks. The game handles turns dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Win Detection:** The app checks for winning conditions in real-time (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) and declares a winner or tie when applicable.
- **Reset Functionality:** A reset button allows players to start a new game without refreshing the page.
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** The game board updates in real-time with visual indicators (blue for 'X' and red for 'O').

The current design is simple and functional, with a minimalistic 4x4 grid layout and a reset button below. This design makes it easy for players to focus on the game without distractions.

## How to Play 🕹

1. **Start the Game:** Open the web app in your browser. You will see a 4x4 grid board ready for the first move.
2. **Player Turns:** Player 'X' starts the game. Click on an empty cell to place your mark. The game will automatically switch turns between 'X' and 'O'.
3. **Win or Tie:** The game will check for four consecutive marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If a player achieves this, a winning message will appear. If all cells are filled without a winner, it declares a tie.
4. **Reset Game:** Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
