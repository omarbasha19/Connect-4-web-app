## Overview üåê

The **Connect 4 Web App** is a browser-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game. It allows two players to compete against each other on a dynamic and responsive 4x4 grid board. This web app leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Interactive 4x4 Grid Board:** The game board is built using CSS Grid, providing a clean and responsive layout.
- **Real-Time Gameplay:** Players take turns by clicking on the grid cells to place their marks. The game handles turns dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Win Detection:** The app checks for winning conditions in real-time (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) and declares a winner or tie when applicable.
- **Reset Functionality:** A reset button allows players to start a new game without refreshing the page.
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** The game board updates in real-time with visual indicators (blue for 'X' and red for 'O').
